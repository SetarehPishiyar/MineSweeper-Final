# Intoduction to MineSweeper
- MineSweeper is one of the most popular games in the world because people of all ages can play it.
- It's easy and brain teaser.

** In this project I tried to simulate this game in c++ using << CLUI >> library.

# How to play
- Run code. (Do not forget to put clui.h in the same folder)
- Choose your game.
- Move with WASD keys.
- If you click on Bombs, You lose.
- You can put flags and save your game.
- Have fun ;)
